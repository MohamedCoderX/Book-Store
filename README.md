Perfect! Since you only have **demo images for the homepage banner and all books page**, we can make a clean **modern GitHub README** using just those images, keeping the rest visually organized and professional. Here’s a ready-to-copy version for GitHub:

✅ This version:  
- Only uses your **available images**.  
- Has clean **modern badges** and structure.  
- Ready to copy-paste into `README.md` on GitHub.  

If you want, I can make a **version that looks “even more modern” with a colorful banner section, feature badges in a row, and a table of technologies**, which makes it **very eye-catching for GitHub viewers**.  

Do you want me to do that?
